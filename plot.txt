deck builder roguelike

mc based on Eltnum

antagonist like black Demifiend

They are friends in the beginning, but when humanity is given power to change the world their paths diverge

Things can change each time you die and loop back, for instance if you lose the final fight the antagonist will realize 
what's going on from the start

The game is ridic hard at first, but each different path to death brings something unique to the next loop, such as two
of the mc being in one loop.
